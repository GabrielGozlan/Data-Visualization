	<h1> International Math Olympiad Rank (1993-2023) </h1>

	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
		The dataset that we have chosen is the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) scores from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asimyousuf/international-math-olympiad-rank-1993-2023">Kaggle</a>. The dataset contains scores of the IMO participants from 1984 to 2017, with breakdown of the individual scores for each problem. The dataset has been cleaned, as the records for the years where the scores for the individual problems are not recorded are omitted. This ensures completeness of the dataset and hence, no data-cleaning needs to be done. 
	</p>
	<p>
		However, the amount of information that we can gather from this one particular dataset is rather limited, as it only focuses on the participants and their scores. We have decided to take another similar dataset, which is on the ranking of each country every year. This way, we are able to relate both datasets, to analyse the performance of the participants, and their relationship with their respective countriesâ€™ overall standing for the year.
	</p>
	<p>
		The dataset represents the countries in country code (e.g. FRA for France), and we have found a Github repository that provides the mapping of the country code to its name: https://github.com/arthurberg/IMO.
	</p>
	<p>We collected data over several sources. For the GDP, we used data from the WorldBank, which traces the GDP/capita from 1960 to 2022. The IMO data was collected on kaggle and records every result from 1984 to 2017.
		We used python to do some data manipulation to create csv files to merge data together, in order to display data on the map. </p>
