			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				The primary goal of our project is to explore and visualize the relationship between a country's economic status, represented by its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and its performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). By using various data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that highlight how economic factors influence educational outcomes, particularly in mathematics. The project includes interactive elements such as an interactive world map, dynamic time axis, and comparative visualizations, enabling users to delve deeply into the data and draw meaningful insights.

			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>
				Our motivation for this project stems from a combination of academic curiosity and a passion for mathematics and data analysis. As data analytics students, we are intrigued by the potential impact of socioeconomic factors on educational achievements. The International Mathematical Olympiad, being a prestigious and globally recognized competition, provides a unique dataset to investigate these impacts.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Academic Curiosity:</strong> We aim to understand how economic conditions affect educational performance. Specifically, we want to see if there is a direct correlation between a countryâ€™s wealth and its success in international competitions like the IMO.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Passion for Mathematics:</strong> Mathematics is a universal language, and excelling in it requires dedication and skill. By analyzing IMO results, we hope to identify factors that contribute to high performance in mathematics, potentially informing educational policies and practices.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Sociological Insights:</strong> We are interested in the broader sociological implications of our findings. Understanding how economic resources and gender equality initiatives impact educational outcomes can help policymakers and educators create more effective strategies to improve learning environments.

			<h2>What are We Trying to Show with the Visualizations?</h2>
			<p>
				The visualizations on our website aim to explore and elucidate the relationship between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). By analyzing various parameters such as the number of medals won, the percentage of female participants, and the progression and regression in country rankings, we strive to uncover patterns and insights that demonstrate how economic factors might influence educational outcomes, particularly in the field of mathematics.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Impact of Economic Conditions on Education:</strong> We aim to show how a country's economic status, as measured by GDP, affects its educational environment and resources. This includes understanding how wealthier countries might invest more in education, leading to better performance in international competitions like the IMO.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> By visualizing the number of medals won by each country over the years, we seek to highlight trends and changes in performance. This helps in understanding which countries have consistently excelled and how their economic conditions might correlate with their success.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Gender Participation:</strong> Another important aspect is the percentage of women participants in the IMO. By visualizing this data, we can assess how economic development and investment in education influence gender equality in competitive mathematics.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Temporal Analysis:</strong> Through the use of interactive time-based visualizations, we enable users to observe how the performance and economic conditions of countries have evolved over time. This temporal analysis helps in identifying long-term trends and the impact of economic changes on educational outcomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> Our visualizations allow for comparative analysis between different countries. Users can compare how countries with similar GDPs perform relative to each other, and how countries with differing economic statuses fare in the IMO. This comparative approach provides deeper insights into the role of economic factors in educational success.

			<h2>Target Audience</h2>
			<p>
				Our target audience includes a diverse group of individuals who share an interest in education, economics, and mathematics. This includes:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Educators and Policymakers:</strong> Individuals who are responsible for shaping educational policies and practices. They can use our findings to make informed decisions about resource allocation, curriculum development, and gender equality initiatives in education.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Researchers and Academics:</strong> Scholars who are interested in the intersection of economics and education. Our visualizations provide a rich dataset for further academic research and analysis.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Mathematics Enthusiasts:</strong> Students, teachers, and anyone with a passion for mathematics. They can explore the data to understand what contributes to success in mathematics competitions and draw inspiration from top-performing countries and students.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>General Public:</strong> Individuals who are curious about the relationship between economic factors and educational outcomes. Our interactive and engaging visualizations make complex data accessible and understandable to a broad audience.
