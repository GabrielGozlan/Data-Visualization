	<h2>Problematic</h2>
	<h4>What am I trying to show with my visualization?</h4>
	<p>
		GDP is a measure that partially represents the economic state of a country, which has an influence on many aspects of the lives of the country's citizens, including education. Both outside of school (less stress, more fulfillment with a stable decent income) and at school (the better the economy is, the more the state can invest in education), even if GDP measures the first category less well, because it does not represent the distribution of money between populations. Countries that are doing well economically will also have more resources to put in place systems to promote gender equality, so GDP has an influence on the proportion of women in science in particular.
	</p>
	<p>
		So with our visualization, we want to show the impact of GDP on the performance of students at the International Mathematics Olympiads on different parameters: percentage of women participants, number of medals, progression and regression in the country ranking and so on.
	</p>

	<h4>Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.</h4>
	<p>The main visualization of our project will be an interactive world map which will allow visualization according to several characteristics already mentioned. It will also be possible to choose the desired country(ies), and a time axis will allow you to choose the desired year(s), with manual progress or by letting the program scroll the years.
		The other visualizations will allow us to give another point of view of the data, such as a visualization in the form of a “race” between countries according to different parameters such as GDP or the number of medals, to highlight the variations and possible correlations between the parameters.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are engineering students, and we find great satisfaction in solving problems, particularly involving mathematics, and also when it is possible to express originality. As a result, the International Mathematics Olympiads arouse our curiosity, and respect for the brilliant students who take it. In addition, education is an important subject for us, and we understand the importance of good working conditions, particularly because EPFL has invested a lot in this area. This is why we find it interesting to look at the links that may exist between GDP and results in the international mathematics Olympics. In this sense, our target audience corresponds to all people who are interested in sociological influences on education and/or mathematics enthusiasts who would like to learn more about the very famous international mathematics Olympics.
